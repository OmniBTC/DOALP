The yellow paper of the omnichain lending protocol is available here: [English](./en/OMNI_Protocol.pdf) and [Chinese](./cn/OMNI_Protocol.pdf) versions.

## OmniLending

OmniLending puts up a situation that with one click, users can deposit assets as collateral on chainA, but borrow assets on chainB, and repay the loans on chainC.

## Protocol Architecture

The core part of the Protocol lies in its settlement system and cross-chain interoperability Protocol.

The settlement system is ChainX, yep, the whole chain serves OmniLending. 

And LayerZero is the first cross-chain interoperability Protocol we have integrated.

The OmniLending Protocol consists of Pool/BridgeAdapter/PoolManage.
